 `This blog` is my personal blog to keep track of my projects and different HOWTOs related to data and tech. I will try to explain in a visual way and in an understandable language, some key concepts of Data Engineering, Data Science, and related technologies.

## About Me   

I am a Computer Scientist (Universidad Central de Venezuela), BI and Data Engineer/Consultant Scientist, working in consulting and support in all areas of BI: Data Science, ETL processes, Pipelines, Data Mining, Data Analysis, Data Governance, Data Quality and Machine Learning in multiple projects and companies.

I have a background in Web Programming, but it's not something I'm passionate about, I prefer to work in application programming, Business Intelligence and Data.

I’m passionate about Data Analytics and Data Science and few years ago discovered that I enjoy coding. Since Data Engineering is at the intersection of both Data Science and Software Engineering - both fields that I love - I decided to concentrate in Data Engineering.

I have strong programming skills in Python and currently learning AWS, Spark, Hadoop and MapReduce. I have solid understanding of Machine Learning and Databases (Oracle, MongoDB, Redis). My previous school [projects](/portfolio) also involved Node.js, Bootstrap, Java, C++.

Currently, I work as a Software Technical Lead at [Govecs](https://www.govecsgroup.com/en/) where I built production-level digital products and solutions for electromobility.

I initially began my career as a Business Intelligence Consultant but transitioned to **Data Science** through rigorous [self-study](https://github.com/franvergara66/data-science-guide).
