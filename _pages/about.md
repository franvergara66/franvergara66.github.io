 `This blog` is my personal blog to keep track of my projects and different HOWTOs related to data and tech. I will try to explain in a visual way and in an understandable language, some key concepts of Data Engineering, Data Science, and related technologies.

## About Me   


I am a Computer Scientist specializing in BI and Data Engineering/Consulting. My expertise encompasses various areas of BI, including Data Science, ETL processes, Pipelines, Data Mining, Data Analysis, Data Governance, Data Quality, and Machine Learning. I have experience working on multiple projects and collaborating with different companies.

While I have a background in Web Programming, my true passion lies in application programming, Business Intelligence, and Data. I thoroughly enjoy Data Analytics and Data Science and have discovered a love for coding. Recognizing that Data Engineering combines both Data Science and Software Engineering, which are fields I am passionate about, I decided to focus on Data Engineering.

My programming skills are strong in Python, and I am currently expanding my knowledge in AWS, .Net, Angular, Spark, Hadoop, and MapReduce. I possess a solid understanding of Machine Learning and have worked with databases such as Oracle, MongoDB, and Redis. Additionally, I have completed  [school projects](/portfolio) involving Node.js, Bootstrap, Java, and C++.

Currently, I hold the position of Software Technical Lead at [TVS Motor Company](https://www.tvsmotor.com/), a renowned global 2-wheeler company. In this role, I have developed production-level digital products and solutions for electromobility.

Although I started my career as a Business Intelligence Consultant, I made a transition to Data Science through intensive self-study, which you can find documented in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/franvergara66/data-science-guide).
